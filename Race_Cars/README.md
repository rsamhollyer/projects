# RACE CARS

This simple simulator runs a 'Drag-Race' type game where the human player races against 3 other computer players.

The AI uses simple set of conditionals and loops to 'roll-die' as a pseudo random number generator to make each game different.

I would like to make this ia bit more robust by incorporating a way to change the lenth of the race and add more vehicles to the race pool.
